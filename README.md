# String Search and Data Compression Algorithms

There are two algorithms we covered in the last computer science course which were brute force and Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) algorithm.

This assignment demonstrates using the brute force and KMP to search a string in the selected data.
When running the assignment, you will need to load a set of data. I would recommend the "war and peace" because it is plain english text. Then search a string in the search bar which will highlight the string within the text.

We also looked at data compression using huffmans coding. The plain text can be compressed into bits that can be seen as binary numbers in a different file. To run this you, can select the compression button which will allow you to select an input file eg "war and peace" and an output file of your choice.

The template files provided for this assignment were the "Assignment5.java" and "HuffmanNode.java".
